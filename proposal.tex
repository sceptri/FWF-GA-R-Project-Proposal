\section{Current state of research}\label{sec:state}

Complex synchronization patterns in neuronal networks are linked to key capabilities of brain, such as memory encoding, information processing, or the generation rhythmic brain activity \cite{Izhikevich2006, Song2018}. Abnormalities in rhythmic brain activity can be attributed to neurological disorders, for example, epilepsy. From the point of view of neuronal dynamics, these abnormalities manifest themselves as anomalous synchronization within neuronal networks and can lead to spontaneous seizures \cite{Jiruska2013}. Abnormal synchronization is often close tied with the presence of \acp{HFO}, \acp{VHFO}, and \acp{UFO} within depth \ac{EEG} recordings from patients with focal epilepsy. This presumed connection has fueled the research interest due to the potential use as biomarkers for epileptogenic zones \cite{Jacobs2008, Worrell2011, Staba2011, Jacobs2012, Zijlmans2012, Brazdil2017, Cimbalnik2018, Cimbalnik2020, Brazdil2023}. Nonetheless, taking into account the physiological limitations of action potential firing rates \cite{Gabbiani2010}, the exact governing mechanism for the generation of such high-frequency signals in neuronal networks remains a mystery \cite{Jiruska2017}.

Existing research endeavors provide insight on how anti-phase synchronization can serve as a potential mechanism for the emergence of \acp{HFO} and \acp{VHFO} in epileptic \ac{EEG} signals \cite{Pribylova2024, Sevcik2024, Zathurecky2025}. Specifically, these analyses, based mostly on techniques of bifurcation theory, theoretically examined small numbers of coupled oscillators and provided numerical computations confirming the findings on a large variety of conductance-based neuron models and scenarios (including stochastic simulations of neuronal populations).

Crucially, the exact relationship between different granularities of neuron clusters is still unknown. More precisely, it remains an open problem how dynamics of intracellular activity of individual conductance-based neuron models, or even coupled neuronal networks consisting of several neurons, influences the \ac{LFP} of the entire epileptogenic cluster. While synchronization between neurons (or their networks) is hypothesized to be a crucial mechanism behind epileptogenic activity, it remains to be seen how exactly is this achieved in the full-scale neuronal cluster and how it propagates to its LFP.

On the side of optimization and \ac{OCT}, models of neuronal populations \cite{Salfenmoser2022, Salfenmoser2024} and their networks \cite{Chouzouris2021} have been the subject of open-loop optimal control techniques. Phase reduction \cite{Zlotnik2012, Dasanayake2011, Pietras2019} techniques were used for control of oscillatory phenomena exhibited by neuronal systems, dramatically simplifying the complex dynamics along stable limit cycles by a phase-only parametrization, allowing even for the study of large-scale networks \cite{Bomela2023}. Moreover, OCT has been used for control of oscillations and network synchrony in neuronal models \cite{Ruths2014, Orieux2024, Popovych2006, Costa2024}.

Neuroscience primarily studies complex networks of a large number of intricately coupled neurons, where emergent properties play a key role in governing the dynamics. As such, system identification has been explored as a tool for aiding understanding of systems' structure, be it for identification of the systems as a whole \cite{Brunton2016}, the discovery of the network configurations \cite{Owens2022} or learning missing terms in dynamical systems undergoing bifurcations \cite{VortmeyerKley2021}. A large variety of approaches have been proposed to deal with input noise, robustness \cite{Kaheman2020, Rosafalco2024}, or utilization of problem-specific properties \cite{Bisheban2017, Jongeneel2022}. Additionally, system identification has been used to enhance other mathematical methods such as optimal control \cite{Morrison2021}, providing invaluable insights into the structure of the systems, which can then be exploited.

Also, there has been an active area of research concerning synchronizability of networks depending on their configuration \cite{Hong2004}. Several factors influencing synchronization capabilities of networks have been proposed and studied with substantial efforts going into exploring this phenomenon on small-world networks \cite{Nishikawa2003}. Kuramoto model of synchronization has been the subject of inquiries into optimal networking design targeted at synchronization \cite{Fazlyab2017, Nishikawa2006} and optimal control, which has been used to replicate measured functional relationships from cortical oscillations in human brain \cite{Menara2022}.

\section{Aims of the project}\label{sec:aims}

% Our principal desire for this project is to connect the bifurcation theory and the optimization viewpoints to neuroscience with special emphasis on focal epilepsy. This connection should reveal currently hidden insights into the governing principles of dynamics of neuronal networks.

This project focuses on advancing the mathematical modeling of focal epilepsy, with an emphasis on identifying the structure and topology of neuron clusters that likely encompass epileptogenic zones. This is achieved through the analysis of multi-scale intracranial \ac{EEG} measurements obtained from specialized electrodes. To examine relationships between measurements at varying granularities, relevant signal features will be defined, providing corresponding loss functions for employment of data-driven and optimization methods.

We strive to set up a mathematically rigorous notion of various signal features (e.g. frequency bands for spiking or bursting, interburst intervals, \acp{VHFO}, and \acp{UFO}, etc.) \cite{Wedler2022} to be used in optimization or epileptic event detection, etc. Modification of current optimization and data-driven methodologies to accommodate for selected signal features is planned. Crucially, such construction should allow for definition and selection of appropriate properties of epileptic \ac{EEG} signals at different granularities, enabling quantifiable comparison not only between each granularity level but also with simulated data.

In parallel, we aim to utilize the techniques of optimal network design and data-driven methods \cite{Baggio2021} to achieve synchronous dynamics with characteristics related to the epileptogenic zone (under physiological constraints). As such, this should closely align with modeling of \ac{LFP} using coupled networks, and performing certain optimization procedures with respect to coupling strengths or delays between oscillators. 

Our third goal lies mostly in system identification, where we wish to study derivative-free methods \cite{Bortz2023, Messenger2024}. Specifically, we will attempt identification of a network configuration from \textit{in vivo}, \textit{in vitro} and \textit{in silico} experimental data. This could provide a concrete neuronal cluster topology and, ideally, improve the localization of the epileptogenic zone based on interictal biomarkers (\acp{HFO}, \acp{VHFO} and \acp{UFO}). Importantly, the identification task should also be focused on discovering models or networks whose solution do not necessarily fit the experiment data exactly, but contain the same signal features.

\section{Innovation}\label{sec:innovation}

We perceive the key contributions to a broader scientific community in several areas. Firstly, the rigorous treatment of signal features should be relevant and highly useful not only in the field of neuroscience, but also among other fields where certain properties of an output signal of a controlled system are desired. In conjunction, development of optimization and data-driven methods affected or constrained by requirements on input or output signal properties should make this framework versatile. Applications for a given system might include detection of events, modeling thereof, and optimal control such that certain requirements on the features of the output signal are fulfilled.

Nevertheless, primary innovation of the proposed project lies in the application of optimization, data-driven methods and the notion of signal features to extract insight about the structure and topology of epileptogenic neuronal clusters and how they behave on different spatial and measurement scales. This should shed more light on \acp{HFO}, \acp{VHFO} and \acp{UFO} and their role as biomarkers of epilepsy. Furthermore, these structural insights will likely be possible to use to improve focal epilepsy biomarkers, more accurately pinpointing the exact epileptogenic area.

% TODO: Maybe, add something about SINDyOC and derivative-free equation discovery methods (and OCT <-> eq. discovery relation)

\section{Methods}\label{sec:methods}

For this project, we are considering two distinct ways of defining signal features -- wavelet theory and topological data analysis. Signal features defined via wavelet theory rely on choosing a reference function, which should ideally capture the essence of our signal feature, and a similarity metric (e.g. inner product in Hilbert space) \cite{Ganjalizadeh2022, Brochard2022, Rocha2011}. The benefit of the approach is the innate inclusion of the notion translations and scaling \cite{Mallat2009} -- two very important properties any reasonable signal feature definition must allow. Definition based on topological data analysis, namely topological invariants or persistent homologies \cite{Carriere2021, Myers2022}, requires far more theoretical background, but it should possibly allow for expression of a wider collection of signal features in mathematically rigorous way. Moreover, either of these two methods can likely succeed each other and thus mitigate the risk of either being unsuitable.

Let us also note the \ac{EEG} data \cite{Brazdil2017} were measured using hippocampal depth electrode implanted within the presurgical investigation of patients suffering from drug-resistant focal epilepsy. The micro-electrodes and macro-electrodes were spatially distributed, and the measured neural mass activities at different places were interconnected in the brain. This introduces the need to study and analyze the dynamics of the subsystems (subpopulations) of neural mass with various interconnections.

The seminal study of the relations between various granularities of the epileptogenic neuronal cluster is to be executed in an iterative fashion. For each iteration of this process, we will primarily specify relevant signal features (at each granularity) and constraints on network topology. With these assumptions, we will test whether we can explain the measured relationship between dynamics on micro- and macro-electrodes. Our secondary goal will be to identify a fitting network such that output signal of the model at each granularity is similar to the measured one.

As one relaxes the constraints on possible network topologies, the search for a fitting one becomes all the harder, necessitating the need for novel optimization and data-driven methods, such as combinatorial optimization \cite{Dai2011}, robust optimization \cite{Ben-Tal2009}, geometric optimal control \cite{Agrachev2004}, turnpike property exploitation \cite{Gugat2024} or convex relaxations \cite{Eltved2021}. Careful consideration of numerical optimization methods, for example, (adaptive) Barzilai-Borwein \cite{Zhou2024}, may prove necessary.

\section{Work plan and timeline}\label{sec:workplan}

% Project description must include:
% - The distribution of work between the partners

% TODO: Change to more closely align with prof. Clason's expertise
We divide our proposed project into 5 tasks spread out over the three year duration, see Table \ref{tab:Gantt} for a Gannt chart of planned progress:

\begin{itemize}
    \item[\textbf{Task 1.}] \textit{(blue)} Definition of key signal features (for example, frequency bands for spiking or bursting, \acp{VHFO} or \acp{UFO}, interburst intervals) via wavelet theory or topologically. Development of event detection techniques based on chosen methodology for verification.
    
    \item[\textbf{Task 2.}] \textit{(purple)} Construction of loss functions corresponding to selected signal features for optimization and data-driven methods. Building analytical and numerical methods for solving proposed problems, including, but not limited to, considerations of discretization, computational complexity, and robustness. Proof-of-concept implementation and numerical experiments.

    \item[\textbf{Task 3.}] \textit{(green)} Modeling of \ac{LFP}, as measured \cite{Brazdil2017} on macro-electrodes, and its relation of micro-electrodes' readings and individual conductance-based intracellular neuron models.

Validation whether said topology can explain measured data.
    
    \item[\textbf{Task 4.}] \textit{(orange)} Study of (derivative-free) data-driven system discovery methods, possibly based on \ac{SINDy} \cite{Brunton2016}, in collaboration with Dr. Sébastien Court from Innsbruck. Consideration of both theoretical analysis and numerical schemes, along with development of suitable numerical experiments. Application of system identification methods to data on individual neurons.

    \item[\textbf{Task 5.}] \textit{(yellow)} Identification of a fitting neuronal network based on selected signal features and constraints on topology of the network from \textit{in vivo}, \textit{in vitro}, and \textit{in silico} data.

\end{itemize}

We aim to submit a co-authored paper (mP1) on derivative-free system identification, inspired by SINDy, in collaboration with Dr. Sébastien Court from the University of Innsbruck. Additionally, we plan to apply event detection methods based on our signal features to real-world \ac{EEG} measurements, contributing to a data analysis paper submission (mP2) in partnership mainly with Dr. Veronika Eclerová, Masaryk University. On a similar note, we expect to submit a publication on the framework of signal feature definition and subsequent optimization together with the results our methodology will yield in regards to LFP and the structure of epileptogenic neuronal networks (mP3).

\section*{Annex 2: Information on the research institution and requested funding}

The requested funding is predominantly for a PhD fellowship for three years. Salary rates were sourced from the \href{https://www.fwf.ac.at/en/funding/steps-to-your-fwf-project/further-information/personnel-costs}{FWF website}. For Associate Professor Lenka Přibylová a monthly salary of 400 € is considered, roughly corresponding to 0.1 full-time equivalent (FTE).

% TODO: Can travel costs really be included?
Moreover, travel costs between Brno and Graz are added for the PhD student, Štěpán Zapadlo, to ease mobility and allow for tighter cooperation of the two international teams. This mobility expense was estimated based on current rates of trains operated on the corresponding route. Thus, one-way ticket is assumed to cost 19 € regardless of direction and one trip in each direction every week is considered. Using 52 weeks in a year, this adds up to approximately 1,976 € in yearly travel costs.
