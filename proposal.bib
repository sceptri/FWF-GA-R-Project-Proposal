    abstract  = {Optimization is everywhere. In science and engineering, optimization is widely used for various applications, and many of the problems that we would like to solve are nonlinear. In general, we do not have ecient methods for solving nonlinear problems, so we have to rely on local optimization methods that provide a candidate solution to our problem with no guarantee of optimality andno bound on the possible suboptimality. For some hard problems, we can use convex relaxation techniques to approximate the original (hard) problem in a certain way by one that we can solve eciently. This approximation, which is a convex optimization problem, gives us a bound on the optimal value of the original problem. This bound can be used to gauge the suboptimality of candidate solutions. Bounds on the optimal value also play an important role in branch-and-bound algorithms for hard combinatorial problems. In some cases, the convex relaxation gives us a solution to the original problem. In this thesis, we are particularly interested in the so-called Shor semidenite relaxation where the convex optimization problem is a semidenite program, i.e., a linear program involving a matrix variable that is constrained to be positive semidenite. This relaxation has proven to be a good approximation for many interesting problems, including the so-called optimal power ow problem, where the goal is to generate and distribute power in a power network at a minimum cost. The goal of the thesis is to contribute to the understanding of convex relaxation and add to the existing toolbox of techniques. We present a numerica study that demonstrates that the semidenite relaxation of the optimal power ow problem can be solved reliably for large power networks in a few minutes. We present a new technique for strengthening the semidenite relaxation for an extended trust region subproblem which as an extension of the classical trust region subproblem. We present a framework for guaranteeing that the semide-nite relaxation of a specic problem class is exact, which means that the problem can be solved eciently by solving the convex relaxation.},

    abstract  = {Lagrange multiplier theory provides a tool for the analysis of a
general class of nonlinear variational problems and is the basis
for developing efficient and powerful iterative methods for
solving these problems. This comprehensive monograph analyzes
Lagrange multiplier theory and shows its impact on the
development of numerical algorithms for problems posed in a
function space setting. The book is motivated by the idea that a
full treatment of a variational problem in function spaces would
not be complete without a discussion of infinite-dimensional
analysis, proper discretization, and the relationship between
the two. The authors develop and analyze efficient algorithms
for constrained optimization and convex optimization problems
based on the augumented Lagrangian concept and cover such topics
as sensitivity analysis, convex optimization, second order
methods, and shape sensitivity calculus. General theory is
applied to challenging problems in optimal control of partial
differential equations, image analysis, mechanical contact and
friction problems, and American options for the Black-Scholes
model. Audience: This book is for researchers in optimization
and control theory, numerical PDEs, and applied analysis. It
will also be of interest to advanced graduate students in
applied analysis and PDE optimization.},
